HIGH TEST UPDATE LOOP. I think I won't bother with loop invalidation, since we'll want little things moving all the time anyway.

Instead, we should bake things into layers and decline to draw most? layers as the animation happens. This could be done with multiple canvases, or in-memory canvases.

anyway: let there be animation.

Wew lads. Just a little time to put in here but wanted to allow click-creating to go with click selecting (I can use a checkbox or whatever to toggle).

Flipping looks OK for houses. Next up I need different kinds of buildings. I'm still concerned that this won't look good aesthetically, but I need to build out stuff like the positioning, animation manager, manipulation tools anyway.

Imbibed the final curieux tonight. Out of beer and tea! Something's in the bureau de poste for the tea problem.

Back at it. I'm concerned that I won't be able to get a *pretty* scene out of a procedural canvas village. I'm considering switching to pixel art instead. :(

Anyway starting the town class, adding containsPoint, adding click/selection functionality, that sort of thing. I know this isn't strictly necessary, but will help with debugging later. Besides, what if people want to interact with the houses eventually?

I probably? won't log much here, there's always the [website captain's log](https://github.com/simonsarris/site-simonsarris/blob/master/captainslog.md) instead.

This project is starting with the idea of recreating a Sebastian-Munster like village scene,
but I will probably diverge wildly on aesthetics. I'm really liking https://twitter.com/soapdpzel right now.

Had a nice pot of jardin bleu this morning.
