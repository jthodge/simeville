Back at it. I'm concerned that I won't be able to get a *pretty* scene out of a procedural canvas village. I'm considering switching to pixel art instead. :(

Anyway starting the town class, adding containsPoint, adding click/selection functionality, that sort of thing. I know this isn't strictly necessary, but will help with debugging later. Besides, what if people want to interact with the houses eventually?

I probably? won't log much here, there's always the [website captain's log](https://github.com/simonsarris/site-simonsarris/blob/master/captainslog.md) instead.

This project is starting with the idea of recreating a Sebastian-Munster like village scene,
but I will probably diverge wildly on aesthetics. I'm really liking https://twitter.com/soapdpzel right now.

Had a nice pot of jardin bleu this morning.
